## Technical Architecture

### Database Schema

```
Employee {
  _id: ObjectId
  name: String
  shifts: [{ day: String, startTime: Time, endTime: Time }]
  machineCertifications: [{ machineId: ObjectId, certificationDate: Date }]
}

Machine {
  _id: ObjectId
  name: String
  tubCapacity: Number (2, 4, or 8)
  productionTime: Number (minutes)
  assignedEmployeeId: ObjectId (nullable)
  status: Enum (available, in-use, maintenance)
}

Recipe {
  _id: ObjectId
  name: String
  ingredients: [{ ingredientId: ObjectId, amount: Number }]
  currentInventory: Number (tubs)
  weeklyProductionGoal: Number (tubs)
  plannedProduction: Number (tubs)
  goalAchievement: Number (percentage)
}

ProductionPlan {
  _id: ObjectId
  weekStartDate: Date
  blocks: [ObjectId] (references ProductionBlock)
  completionStatus: Number (percentage)
  notes: String
}

ProductionBlock {
  _id: ObjectId
  planId: ObjectId
  startTime: DateTime
  endTime: DateTime
  blockType: Enum (prep, production, cleaning)
  machineId: ObjectId
  employeeId: ObjectId
  recipeId: ObjectId
  tubQuantity: Number
  status: Enum (scheduled, in-progress, completed)
}
```

### Key Workflows

#### Creating a New Production Block

1. User selects empty time slot or uses "Add Block" button
2. System presents block creation form
3. User selects:
   - Block type (prep, production, cleaning)
   - Machine
   - Employee (with validation for qualifications)
   - Recipe (for production blocks)
   - Quantity (for production blocks)
4. System validates:
   - Machine availability
   - Employee availability
   - Time constraints (operating hours)
   - Required prep/cleaning time
5. Block is added to schedule with appropriate visualization

#### Production Goal Tracking

1. System calculates total planned production for each recipe
2. Visual indicators show progress towards weekly goals
3. Warnings displayed for recipes below target
4. Dashboard shows overall production plan completion percentage

#### Schedule Validation

1. Real-time validation for:
   - Machine conflicts
   - Employee scheduling conflicts
   - Missing prep/cleaning blocks
   - Operating hour violations
2. Visual indicators for conflicts
3. Suggestions for resolution of conflicts
4. Prevention of save with critical conflicts
